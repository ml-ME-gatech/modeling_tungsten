    "-  recrystallization of the warm-rolled tungsten plate is a thermally activated process governed by jumps of individual tungsten atoms. [1]\n",
    "- The 'incubation time' is then a period of recovery where sub-grains with low-angle boundaries (<1–2°) begin to accumulate dislocations and become increasingly \n",
    "misoriented with respect to their neighbors. The increase in misorientation increases the mobility of the boundary and so the rate of growth of the sub-grain increases.\n",
    "- Avrami Model are phenomenological models describing the kinetics of isothermal phase transitions which proceed through nucleation and growth.\n",
    "- Recrystallization being a thermally activated process, relationships between JMAK parameters and Ta are usually described by Arrhenius laws [2]\n",
    "- The Arrhenius equation gives the dependence of the rate constant of a chemical reaction on the absolute temperature as:\n",
    "    $k = A \\exp{-E_a/(RT)}$\n",
    "    - $k$ is the rate constant (frequency of collisions)\n",
    "    - $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n",
    "    - $A$ is a factor (possibly temperature dependent)\n",
    "    - $E_a$ is the molar activation energy for the reaction\n",
    "    - $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n",
    "- recrystallization temperatures depends on the level of cold deformation applied during manufacturing and values in the range 1100–1500 °C have been found [2]\n",
    "    - for example, Wang et. al [3] found that significantly reducing the thickness by rolling the samples saw large changes in the recrystaillization kinetics.\n",
    "- Premautre cracking in tungsten armor has been observed, attributed two competing rovery and recrystillization processes.\n",
    "- A recent investigation on two tungsten supplies according to ITER specifications has highlighted that hardness abatement at high temperature leads to overestimate the recrystallization fraction, which may be a consequence of the significant contribution of recovery during annealing\n",
    "- recovery is the decrease of dislocation density and other crystal defects over time\n",
    "- Neutron irradiation seems to increase the recrystallization resistance of W\n",
    "    - In W bar, void dissolution occurs before recrystallization, meaning that an annealing regime exists where a large part of the irradiation damage is healed while softening from recrystallization is avoided.\n",
    "- quantify recrystallization and recovery occurring in the same time by the means of hardness abatement and EBSD. It has clearly confirmed that there is a significant discrepancy between softening kinetics and recrystallization kinetics as claimed by Richou _ et al. _ [4]\n",
    "- Softening and recrystillization kinetics are distinct [4]\n",
